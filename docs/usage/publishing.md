# Publishing models

Furiosa Artifacts use model class in [furiosa-registry](https://github.com/furiosa-ai/furiosa-sdk/tree/main/python/furiosa-registry/) to publish models. `furiosa-registry` will find available models via a descriptor file named `artifacts.py`.

To publish models, as a model provider you need to add function entrypoints which returns a model instance in `artifacts.py`

> Since github is not suitable for storing large data files, please use **[DVC](https://dvc.org/)** for such purpose. A detailed description can be found on [this section](#how-to-use-dvc-for-furiosa-artifacts)


## Example

``` python title="artifacts.py"
--8<-- "docs/examples/publish_model.py"
```

What's going on here:

`class ResNet18_Model(Model)`

Model class implements `furiosa.registry.Model`. `furiosa.registry.Model` is a class which you have to implement to publish your model. This model class is based on a [pydantic Model](https://pydantic-docs.helpmanual.io/usage/models/) and have several required fields to fill including:

- `name` model name.
- `model` model binary bytes.
- `format` model binary format. "onnx" or "tflite" are supported.

---

`def preprocess(self, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> Any`

`def postprocess(self, *args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> Any`

Additional functions to support model modification. As a model provider, you can add pre-process, post-process functions to provide model specific functionalities. Note that this custom functions are not defined via interface which means you can add any custom functions.

As users does not know which functions are provided, you have to document these functions to allow clients to use models correctly.

---

`async def ResNet18(*args: Any, **kwargs: Any) -> ResNet18_Model`

Function entrypoint which will be called from `furiosa-registry`.

---

`model=await loader.read("models/resnet18.onnx")`

Loading model binary bytes via `furiosa.registry.client.transport`. You may use different ways to load binary bytes depending on how you maintain your model binary.

## How to use DVC for Furiosa Artifacts

### DVC

Model binary files(e.g. `*.onnx`, `*.tflite`) are usually too large for github to process.
Therefore we handle these files with [DVC](https://dvc.org/), a version control system specialized for handling ML models and data sets.

### DVC installation
You can install DVC by following this [instruction](https://dvc.org/doc/install).

You probably need `dvc[s3]` python package since this repository uses s3 as DVC's backend.

### DVC pipelines

Since DVC does not support anonymous logins & downloads for s3 backend ([related issue](https://github.com/iterative/dvc/issues/5797)), we have separated endpoints by purpose. You can also refer to the [actual configuration file](https://github.com/furiosa-ai/furiosa-artifacts/blob/main/.dvc/config).

1. `origin` backend
    - An https endpoint.
    - We use this endpoint to download files without any AWS credentials.
2. `s3origin` backend
    - An s3 protocol endpoint.
    - We use this endpoint to upload files to s3 bucket.

---

- Download model files via DVC
  ```bash
  # `origin` is specified in [.dvc/config](.dvc/config),
  # -j option specifies num of parallel downloads
  $ dvc pull -r origin -j 10
  ```

- Add a new data via DVC
  ```bash
  # `s3origin` is specified in [.dvc/config](.dvc/config),
  # We use `s3origin` remote as DVC does not currently support uploading files via https endpoint
  $ touch ./models/example-model
  $ dvc add -R ./models/example-model
  $ dvc push -r s3origin
  # Please follow DVC's instructions to follow these changes with git
  ```
